# KCPotterApp

## Description:

The KC Potter App is an iOS application designed to connect students with Vanderbilt's Center for LGBTQI Life and supplement support resources for members of the community and allies.
The app can help identify close by gender neutral bathrooms, add the KC Potter events to personal calendars, and reach center staff or other relevant local recourses based on responses to interactive Q&A prompts.

Framework - We are going to use a three tier app framework which will utilize the IOS app, an API system, and a database in the backend. 
Database - We decided to utilize Mongo Realm for our backend database.
Packages:
File -> Packages -> Reset Package Caches
Do not push: KC\ Potter.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved

## Installation:
App is installed for free from App Store on iPhone at: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vanderbilt-kc-potter-center/id1617118771 . Please make sure to manually enable location from phone settings so that it can show up in the bathroom navigation page.

## Deployment:
Initial deployment completed. Approved version by App Store does not contain the Calendar Web View page for COVID-19 privacy reasons (section on KC Potter Center's webiste was found to violate App Store guidelines). Off loading has been performed in detail with the client who will resubmit once their website has been changed in compliance to Apple COVID policy, and who has access to databases to alter data like bathroom locations and resource links / listings for future App Store submissions.

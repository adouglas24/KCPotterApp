# KCPotterApp

Description:
The KC Potter App is an iOS application designed to connect students with and supplement Vanderbilt KC Potter Center LGBTQI support resources.
The app can help identify close by gender neutral bathrooms, add the KC Potter events to personal calendars, and reach center staff or other relevant local recourses based on responses to interactive Q&A prompts.

Framework: We are going to use a three tier app framework which will utilize the IOS app, an API system, and a database in the backend. 

Database: We decided to utilize Mongo Realm for our backend database.
